### Simplified Bakery Algorithm

The bakery algorithm is a mutual exclusion algorithm for N threads. There is a code in the directory `locks/simplified-bakery/` where we use an AtomicInteger to simplify the original's bakery algorithm. The code in this directory uses the same Counter used in the code of the directory `semaphores/mutex/`.
